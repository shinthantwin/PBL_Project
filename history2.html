  <h1>History of Italy</h1>
  <p>Thousands of Lower Paleolithic artefacts have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo, dating as far back as 850,000 years.<br>Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence dating back to the Middle Palaeolithic period some 200,000 years ago,<br> while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi. Archaeological sites from this period include Addaura cave, Altamura, Ceprano, and Gravina in Puglia.</p> </div>

<h1>Pisa Tower</h1>

<p>The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight. It worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.<a href="https://www.towerofpisa.org/">See More</a></p>

<h1>Ancient Rome</h1>

<p>Ancient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, beside the River Tiber in the Italian Peninsula. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, and came to control its neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength. It eventually controlled the Italian Peninsula, assimilated the Greek culture of southern Italy (Magna Grecia) and the Etruscan culture, becoming a dominant power in the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/resource-library-ancient-rome/">See More</a></p>

<p>The Roman Empire was the post-Republican state of ancient Rome and is generally understood to mean the period and territory ruled by the Romans following Octavian's assumption of sole rule under the Principate in 31 BC. It included territory in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, and was ruled by emperors. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 conventionally marks the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages.Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond, but became severely destabilized in civil wars.<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/ancient-medieval/roman-a/a/roman-empire">See More</a></p>

<h1>Flag of Italy</h1>
<img src="https://heritage-flag.com/cdn/shop/products/italy-flag.jpg?v=1418057957" width="47%">

<p>The Italian Flag Day named Tricolour Day was established by law n. 671 of 31 December 1996, and is held every year on 7 January. This celebration commemorates the first official adoption of the tricolour as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, a Napoleonic sister republic of Revolutionary France, which took place in Reggio Emilia on 7 January 1797, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789â€“1799) which, among its ideals, advocated national self-determination.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy">See More</a> </p>
